Clone this site , https://www.auf-nach-mv.de/magazin/bikepacking-seenplatte-mecklenburgische-schweiz  notice the image is theresult from this code . I ahve uploaded
a snapshot of how the site looks like . Then I am added png that ilustratrate parallax effect as scene_1 and scene_2. Notice that in the rendered image you don't see
the parallax. Also the menu is staying on the top during the entire flow, but the parallax image are going on top of the navigation menu. The parallax I show show
scene_1 and scene_2, from parts_1 to part_5 and from part_1 to part_7 respectively, and there can see as the user scrolls theimages are overlaped on top of the
other, but the text is flowing normally. Giving it this "parallax" effect. There are two scenes becuase these two differnt ways, one has text and other is just
images with with 100%. Also the images a lazy loaded and device adjusted, so it loads different sizes according to different devices. Right now we can Analize the
original size to see what can you can understand from it, and also guide your self from the images I have provided for entiresite and scene effects. We want svelte
3.59 and routify2 code from it . With all reusable components. Copy the data inside as json file or files and load it with fetch OnMount(), use store if necessary.
No auth needed for now. only front end. We want to precision and exact clone. Please review and check against the image to make sure we accomplish. Repeat checking
it until we reach the goal of rendering the right clone. Make sure the Parallax effect is added. The live page I provide has more than once or twice parrallax. I
only show two but I expect you will notice all others from the live page, and apply accordingly to this clone . Check qualityagain.    [velophil_new_image_2026.png

velophil_cool_site_2026/20260101_velophil_svelte/frontend we already have a
version of svelte "svelte": "^4.2.19" so I will amend my wish and use this
verion instead of routify 2, which si already installed too. I am using bun
to run stuff and ./dev.sh file has sample run command, there is also suite
of cucumber and playwright install too
